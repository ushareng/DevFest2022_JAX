# DevFest2022_JAX
Accelearting Machine Learning Research using JAX

JAX is a system for high-performance machine learning research. It offers the familiarity of Python+NumPy and the speed of hardware accelerators, and it enables the definition and the composition of function transformations useful for machine learning programs. In particular, these transformations include automatic differentiation, automatic batching, end-to-end-compilation (via XLA), and parallelizing over multiple accelerators. They are the key to JAX's power and to its relative simplicity.This talk will give a brief  introduction to JAX features.
